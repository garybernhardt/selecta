# Selecta

Selecta is a fuzzy selector. You can use it for fuzzy selection in the style of
Command-T, ctrlp, etc. You can also use it to fuzzy select anything else:
command names, help topics, identifiers; anything you have a list of.

I wrote it to select things from vim, but it has no dependency on vim at all.
Its interface is dead simple:

* Pass it a list of choices on stdin.
* It will present a pretty standard fuzzy selection interface to the user (and
  block until they make a selection or kill it).
* It will print the user's selection on stdout.

For example, you can say:

```
cat $(ls *.txt | selecta)
```

which will prompt the user to fuzzy-select one of the text files in the current
directory, then print the contents of whichever one they choose. It looks like
this:

Selecta does not:

- Read from or write to the disk.
- Know about any editors (including vim).
- Know what it's searching.
- Perform any actions on the item you select.
- Change the order of the choices piped in. (But you can always put a `| sort
  |` in your pipeline if you want them sorted.)

It supports these keys:

- ^W to delete the word before the cursor
- ^N to select the next match
- ^P to select the previous match
- ^C to quit without selecting a match

Ranking algorithm:

- Select each input string that contains all of the characters in the query.
  They must be in order, but don't have to be sequential. ("ct" will match
  "cat" and "crate".)
- Shorter match substrings rank higher (when searching for "ct", "cat" ranks
  higher than "crate" because "cat" is shorter than "crat", which is the part
  of "crate" that matches).
- Shorter overall strings match higher ("foo.rb" ranks higher than
  "foo_spec.rb").
- Prefer letters at the start of "words"
- Prefer contiguous to isolated letters

## Installation

Selecta requires Ruby 1.9 or better.

For now, copy the `selecta` script to your path. ~/bin is a great place for it.
If you don't currently have a ~/bin, just do `mkdir ~/bin` and add
`export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"` to your .zshrc, .bashrc, etc.

Selecta is *not installable as a gem*! Gems are only good for
application-specific tools. You want Selecta available at all times. If it were
a gem, it would sometimes disappear when you said `rvm use`.

## Use with Vim

There's no actual vim plugin yet. It may not end up needing one; we'll see. For
now, you can just stick this in your .vimrc:

```vimscript
" Run a given vim command on the results of fuzzy selecting from a given shell
" command. See usage below.
function! SelectaCommand(choice_command, selecta_args, vim_command)
  try
    silent let selection = system(a:choice_command . " | selecta " . a:selecta_args)
  catch /Vim:Interrupt/
    " Swallow the ^C so that the redraw below happens; otherwise there will be
    " leftovers from selecta on the screen
    redraw!
    return
  endtry
  redraw!
  exec a:vim_command . " " . selection
endfunction

" Find all files in all non-dot directories starting in the working directory.
" Fuzzy select one of those. Open the selected file with :e.
nnoremap <leader>f :call SelectaCommand("find * -type f", "", ":e")<cr>
```

## Examples

### Check out a git branch

```
$ git branch | cut -c 3- | selecta | xargs git checkout
```

When you say `git branch`, you get something like this:

```
* master
  mytopic
  release
```

The `cut` removes those first two columns. Then we just select a branch and use
it as an argument to `git checkout`.

### Search for files based on identifier under the cursor in Vim

When you put your cursor anywhere in the word "User" and press `<c-g>`, this
mapping will open Selecta with the search box pre-populated with "User". It's
an quick and dirty way to find files related to an identifier.

```vimscript
function! SelectaIdentifier()
  " Yank the word under the cursor into the z register
  normal "zyiw
  " Fuzzy match files in the current directory, starting with the word under
  " the cursor
  call SelectaCommand("find * -type f", "-s " . @z, ":e")
endfunction
nnoremap <c-g> :call SelectaIdentifier()<cr>
```

## FAQ

**Won't this be slow?**

Nope: startup and termination together burn about 23 ms of CPU on my machine (a
mid-2011 MacBook Air). File finding may be slow, but, speaking of that...

**What about caching, selecting only certain file types, etc.?**

Those are different problems. This is just a simple fuzzy finding user
interface. It could be combined with caching, etc. I don't use caching myself,
prefering to keep repos small, so no-caching was a design requirement.
